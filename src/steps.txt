Step-by-step recursion flow

Call #1 → printValues(person)

Look at "name" → value "Alice" is flat → print name: Alice

Look at "address" → value is object → call printValues(address)

Call #2 → printValues(address)

Look at "city" → value "Paris" is flat → print city: Paris

Look at "coordinates" → value is object → call printValues(coordinates)

Call #3 → printValues(coordinates)

Look at "lat" → value 48.8566 is flat → print lat: 48.8566

Look at "lng" → value 2.3522 is flat → print lng: 2.3522

Look at "details" → value is object → call printValues(details)

Call #4 → printValues(details)

Look at "timezone" → value "CET" is flat → print timezone: CET

No more properties → function ends for this call.

Return flow:

Call #4 ends → return to Call #3 after "details" loop.

Call #3 ends → return to Call #2 after "coordinates" loop.

Call #2 ends → return to Call #1 after "address" loop.

Call #1 ends → recursion is complete.
